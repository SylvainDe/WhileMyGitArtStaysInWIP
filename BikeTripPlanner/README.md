Trying to organise a bike trip usually means going back and forth between various resources (towns, distances, accomodation) to try to group information into some meaningful document (map, spreadsheet, etc).

It could be nice to be able to have a small tool to have this done automatically.



Minimal features:

 - find the route between 2 points and split it into segments of equal lengths (1 for each day of the trip)

   - Possible resources

     - Google Maps: https://www.google.fr/maps
     - GeoVelo: https://www.geovelo.fr
     - Komoot: https://www.komoot.com
     - BikeMap: https://www.bikemap.net

 - view result as both a map and a table with a summary of each day (starting point, ending point, total distance, elevation)


Optional features:

 - export data on a map

 - display train stations

 - display available accomodations

   - Possible resources

     - Booking.com: https://www.booking.com ( https://developers.booking.com/api/index.html ? )
     - HostelWorld: https://www.hostelworld.com
     - AirBnb: https://www.airbnb.fr
     - WarmShowers: https://fr.warmshowers.org

 - display expected weather on starting and ending points for each day of the trip


Status: I won't probably go any further than just writing the README but who knows...
