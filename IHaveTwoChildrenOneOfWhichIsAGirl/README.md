Trying to wrap my mind around the ideas the the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDZieLmya_I ("This May Be The Most Counterintuitive Probability Paradox I've Ever Seen | Can you spot the error?") and the follow-up video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElB350w8iJo ("The Boy or Girl Probability Paradox Resolved | It was never really a paradox").


Hoping that launching simulations will help me get the insight.
